Data Preprocessing
Load the dataset.
Handle missing values (if any).
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Normalize or standardize features (if necessary).
Model Building
Create a neural network architecture (e.g., using TensorFlow or PyTorch).
Experiment with different hyperparameters (number of layers, neurons, activation functions, optimizer, etc.).
Train the model on the training set.
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Evaluation
Analyze the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.
Consider techniques like cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
Visualize results (e.g., confusion matrix, ROC curve).
Additional Considerations
Explore different deep learning architectures (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks).
Investigate feature engineering techniques to improve model performance.
Consider using techniques like regularization to prevent overfitting.
